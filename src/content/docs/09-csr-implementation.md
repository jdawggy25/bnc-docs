# CSR Software Implementation

## Current State: Where You Are Now

**Prepared for:** BNC Builders Inc.
**Prepared by:** Comcreate
**Date:** December 2025

## The Problem

Your CSR team is fighting an uphill battle every day. Communication is scattered across multiple platforms, leads fall through the cracks, and there's no visibility into what's working.

### Current Pain Points

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Communication scattered (texts, emails, calls on separate platforms) | Lost conversations, slow response times |
| No centralized lead history | CSR can't see full picture per lead |
| No automated reminders | Missed follow-ups, inconsistent experience |
| No production tracking | Can't measure CSR performance |
| Manual repetitive work | Wasted time, human error |
| Office number can't text | Confusion, unprofessional appearance |
| Leads from 6+ platforms | Manual checking, delayed responses |

### Where Leads Currently Come From

```
Google        →  Manual check
Yelp          →  Manual check
Meta (FB/IG)  →  Manual check
Angi          →  Separate inbox
Scorpion      →  Separate system
Website Forms →  Email notification
Phone Calls   →  Separate system
```

**Result:** CSR juggles 5+ apps, loses track of conversations, and leads slip away.

## What We're Going to Do
