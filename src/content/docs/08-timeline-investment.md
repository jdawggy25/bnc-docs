### Paid Advertising Management — 12.5% of Ad Spend

| Monthly Ad Spend | Management Fee | Total Hours |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| $5,000 | $625 | 6-8 hrs |
| $7,500 | $937.50 | 8-10 hrs |
| $10,000 | $1,250 | 10-12 hrs |
| $10,300 (recommended) | $1,287.50 | 10-12 hrs |
| $15,000 | $1,875 | 14-16 hrs |
| $20,000 | $2,500 | 18-20 hrs |

**Why percentage-based pricing?**

Ad management workload scales directly with spend. Higher budgets require:
- More campaigns and ad groups to manage
- Increased bid adjustments and optimization frequency
- Additional creative variations and A/B testing
- More granular audience segmentation
- Enhanced reporting and analysis depth
- Greater strategic oversight and risk management

Industry standard for professional ad management ranges from 10-20% of spend. Our 12.5% rate reflects dedicated, hands-on management with daily optimization—not set-and-forget automation.
