# Research Phase 2: Technical Discovery

## Initial Findings from Target Sites
Analysis of the 5 reference sites confirms a consistent foundation with tiered complexity.

**Common Stack Elements:**
- **Core:** Next.js (React Framework)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Forms/Email:** Likely Nodemailer / Resend integration
- **Hosting/Performance:** Fast load times indicative of Vercel or similar Next.js-optimized hosting.

**Tier Differentiation:**

| Tier | Price | Characteristics | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | ~$3k | Clean, functional, standard UI components, local SEO focus, basic interactivity. | San Diego Ruben Real Estate |
| **Mid-Range** | ~$5k | Polished design, better asset quality, embedded media (video), blogs for content marketing, integrated tools (calculators, chatbots). | Key Real Estate, Spanish Horizons, Casita Azul |
| **Premium** | ~$7.5k+ | High-end custom design, advanced animations (Motion), complex integrations (dashboards, portals), "LLMSEO" (advanced semantic structuring for AI search). | V3 Biomedical |

## Next Steps
Proceed to define specific technical requirements and constraints for the "Comcreate" proposal to mirror this range.
