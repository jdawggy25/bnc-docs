# Paid Advertising Strategy

## Overview

Paid advertising gets you in front of people **actively searching** for your services (Google) and **likely to need** your services (Meta).

**Goal:** Generate qualified leads at a sustainable cost per acquisition.

## Google Ads Strategy

### Why Google Ads?

When someone searches "kitchen remodeling escondido," they're ready to buy. Google Ads puts you at the top of that search.

**Your current situation:**
- No Google Ads running (per SEMrush: 0 paid keywords)
- Competitors are bidding on your service terms
- Leaving money on the table

- Let Google optimize for your target cost per lead

**Target CPL:** $75-100 (adjustable based on actual performance)

### Landing Page Strategy

**Don't send ads to the homepage.**

- Headline matching ad copy
- Service-specific imagery
- Trust signals (reviews, certifications)
